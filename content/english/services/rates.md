| HPC Priority |208 | 1,500 | 2 Standard GPUs | 96 | Yes | $200 | Batch 
| HPC Priority+ | 416 | 3,000 | 2 Standard GPUs | 96 | Yes | $400 | Batch
| Standard GPU Priority| 8 | 192 | 4 Standard GPUs | 96 | Yes | $400 | GPU
| Standard GPU Priority+ | 16 | 384 | 8 Standard GPUs | 96 | Yes | $400 | GPU
| High End GPU Priority | 16 | 256 | 4 high-end GPUs (Tesla V100) | 96 | Yes | $400 | GPU
| Large Memory Priority | 32 | 2TB | - | 96 | Yes | $100 | Bigmem

> Storage Quotas for every account (except Individual Exploratory):
* 20G Home Directory
* 512G Scratch (files and directories older than 30 days are purged)
* 1TB Data Directory (shared amongst members of the group) by default.

> GPU Definition:
* Standard - QuadroRTX or lower
* HighEnd - Tesla v100

> Exploratory accounts are available to all faculty and PIs at Brown at no cost. 
> Priority accounts have a higher Quality-of-Service (QOS) i.e. priority accounts will have faster job start times.

> *The maximum number of cores and duration may change based on cluster utilization. For example - HPC Priority account has a Quality-of-Service (QOS) allowing up to 208 cores, 1TB memory, and a total per-job limit of 998,400 core-minutes. This allows a 208-core job to run for 80 hours, a 104-core job to run for 160 hours, or 208 1-core jobs to run for 80 hours.


# Staff Services
| Support Level | Description | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General Support | Limited code troubleshooting, training, office-hours. Limited to 1 week per year | $0
| Advanced Support | Any staff services requiring more than 1 week's effort per year | $85/hour |
| Project Collaboration | Percent time of a specific staff member charged directly to the grant | %FTE |

# Research Data Storage

* 1TB per Brown Faculty Member - Free
* 10TB per awarded Grant at the request of a Brown PI - an active grant account number will be required to provide this allocation and the data will be migrated to archive storage at the end of the grant.
* Additional Storage Allocation - Year to Year - $100 / Terabyte / year
